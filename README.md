Create a graphical 4x4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Before loading the GUI, the programmer will be able to select a human player or an AI from a list of available AIs. The user will do this for both the x-player and o-player.

When both the players are AIs, the user will be prompted for how many games each player AI will player as X and O, the number of milliseconds to wait between each move and the number of milliseconds to display the winning move, before starting the next game. After playing AI vs AI games, the console will display how many wins/loses/ties each AI received. Human players will enter moves by clicking on the location they want to move to. When at least one Human is playing, a finished game can be reset with the 'r' key. Implements a Monte Carlo tree search design to analyze the game board in the future to suggest moves.
